Here is my take on the Mutable Instruments Branches. The Grenar is a throughhole one pcb version of the Bernoulli gate from MI. 
This one just as the Grids Clone "Gris" uses an Arduino Nano as the brains. 
I had a bunch of troubles doing this module which I will tell you all about in this video. 
You can find this module in my Tindie store along with previous modules:

Here is a quick video showing you how to get the .HEX file onto the Arduino Nano:
