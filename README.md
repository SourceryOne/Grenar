Here is my take on the Mutable Instruments Branches. The Grenar is a throughhole one pcb version of the Bernoulli gate from MI. 
This one just as the Grids Clone "Gris" uses an Arduino Nano as the brains. 
I had a bunch of troubles doing this module which I will tell you all about in this video. 
You can find this module in my Tindie store along with previous modules:

Here is a quick video showing you how to get the .HEX file onto the Arduino Nano:

IMPORTANT TPCarlson (Twig) found a "bug" between the hex file and some Arduino nano clones with the old bootloader which messes up the first channel, if ch1 misbehaves use the second HEX file on this page for old bootloaders.

Here is a link to some cheap Arduino nano clones that worked for me:

I also made an alternate front panel for another firmware called Twigs, which converts the Branches/Grenar into a CV Factor and CV Swing module. Basically a divider/multiplier and a Swing module.
